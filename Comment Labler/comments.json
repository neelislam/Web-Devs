    "Comments": "entrylevel today midlate career tomorrow starting with the great decoupling in the s human labor has been and will continue trending to zero think exponentially not linearly automation and robotics will necessarily replace human workers due to the current economic system think about thistoday ai is the worst it will ever be going forward it doesnt matter if ai creates million new jobs ai will solve and execute these new jobs much faster than humans will be able to adapt learn and fill them capitalemployee modelit worked great for quite a while however now companies that automate lower their costs become more competitive those that keep highercost human labor necessarily fall behind and will go out of business this creates a system where replacing people with machines is not just likely but necessary for company survival there is a way to deal with this humanely but it would require a full revamp of the social contract and our concept of work even capitalists will want this change when unemployment reaches a tipping point and theres no one left with money to buy the crap theyre selling i wrote a paper in and the progression is right about where i thought it would be the paper the end of work as we know it explored how rapid advances in artificial intelligence robotics and automation are fundamentally reshaping the nature of work and the global economy i argued that unlike past technological revolutions modern aidriven changes threaten to eliminate not just manual or repetitive jobs but also many roles traditionally considered safe including those requiring creativity analysis or interpersonal skills as machines become increasingly capable the need for human labor in many sectors will evaporate leading to widespread job displacement and a potential crisis of purpose and income for millions the paper discussed how this transition challenges traditional economic and social structures including the link between work and personal identity as well as the mechanisms by which people earn a living i suggested that society must adapt by rethinking education social safety nets and the concept of work itself potentially embracing universal basic income ubi as a transitory stopgap or other models that decouple survival from employment note ubi is not the end goal but just a transitioning tool the paper called for proactive planning and open dialogue to ensure that the benefits of automation are broadly shared and that individuals can find meaning and security in a postwork world unfortunately not unsurprisingly humanity has totally botched it up to this point reasoning ai is the next big leap the future of ai is not just about generating answers but about reasoning breaking down complex problems stepbystep more like a human brain breakthroughs like deepseeks opensource reasoning models are already being incorporated into platforms like gpt and xai marking a shift toward more advanced thoughtful ai think exponentially not linearly theres a persistent and misleading narrative circulating often perpetuated by short term goaldriven institutions like politicians universities and tech company executives that the future of work is secure the claim goes you just need to learn how to work with ai and humans collaborating with ai will outperform either one alone but recent research including a landmark study from the university of virginia tells a different story in diagnosing medical conditions ai alone achieved far greater accuracy than either human doctors or even doctors assisted by ai the median diagnostic accuracy for the docs using chat gpt plus was while the results for the physicians using conventional approaches was sounds like a win at first however chat gpt plus alone achieved a median diagnostic accuracy of more than in other words the comforting idea that humans will always be essential partners to machines is crumbling in many fields ai is not just a tool it is the superior performer this has staggering implications for the future of work especially to the often used solution of prior technological displacement that go you just need to be retrained to the group advocating the retraining solution i pose to you this you have a medical doctor just finished years of higher education a lowpaid year internshipresidency is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and just got outperformed by automation what would you have this doctor retrained into that will offer a secure job the result of this since the united states moronic system is based on taxing employees for about of all tax revenue this will further exacerbate the problem tax needs to be based on whats going on now and in the future not what worked years ago oh i know its so evil to think but we might need to tax the companies who are doing the automation even if you do that its a winwin for instance say a company had employees in automated away down to employees paid federal taxes including payroll tax of about million a year now the people pay about million a year however by automating the company sees two things they are no longer paying approximately million in wages and their share of payroll tax and since nobody automates to lose money they also have higher profits whats so wrong about taxing that company for the million dollars they dont have to pay anymore and a fair percentage of their additional profits they now make through the automation not all the additional profits but some of them if you do that theres a higher tax revenue and more profits for the company thats a winwin for the government and for businesses if humanity as a whole werent so stupid we would just adjust as tech progresses to where everyone benefits somewhat from each stage and just move smoothly into the postlabor economy to understand this shift consider the historical role of the horse and oxen they were once essential to the economy as sources of power for agriculture transport and industry technologies like the horse collar and the steel plow dramatically increased their output making them even more valuable but then came the steam engine and later the internal combustion engine these machines didnt just help the horse but outperformed it entirely trains tractors and trucks could do the job ten even a hundred times faster and more powerfully and from that moment forward the horse was no longer critical to economic output it was in essence unemployed this is what ai and robotics are doing to human labor they are not simply replacing the repetitive or the physical they are increasingly outperforming humans in cognition strategy design and communication and just like the horse our value in the economic system will diminish not from lack of talent or effort but because machines will do the job better thats why we need to start thinking not in terms of retraining but about restructuring society itself for a world where human labor is no longer essential to production when the very essence of what makes an entity useful to the current economy is superseded be that strength endurance dexterity analysis creativity empathy intelligence persuasion as well as many other qualities that entity becomes irrelevant to economic output potential solution decentralized ai ownership a bridge toward postscarcity while universal basic income ubi may serve as an initial economic stopgap bridging todays economy with tomorrows abundance consider an even more equitable and longterm solution decentralizing the ownership of artificial intelligence itself rather than concentrating the power of ai in the hands of a few corporations or governments envision a model where ai entities are opensource and collectively owned this could take the form of assigning each person a digital share of an ai system not unlike a stakeholders share in a company as the ai produces value whether through intellectual labor creative output or autonomous economic participation those shares would generate dividends distributed directly to individuals this model would ensure that as ai becomes the dominant productive force in society the wealth it creates is shared universally not monopolized it aligns with the principle that the fruits of public knowledge made possible by centuries of human collaboration should benefit everyone not just a few early adopters or private entities in practice this could look like ai systems running decentralized autonomous organizations daos that distribute profits algorithmically smart contracts ensuring transparent equitable income flows based on collective stake global ai cooperatives where users vote on how ai is used improved and deployed universal basic compute if ai becomes the primary driver of economic output then equitable access to its benefits isnt just fair its necessary to avoid deepening inequality and instability it provides a scalable technologically aligned extension to ubi ensuring people not only have income but true economic participation in the age of intelligent machines ultimately decentralized ai ownership may be the last transition phase before full postscarcity when advanced technologies like universal nanofactories or matter compilers render even economic structures obsolete until then however models like this offer a way to reclaim agency in a world where production no longer requires human hands and where wealth can for the first time in history truly be universal",

    "Comments": "given near perfect historic correlation and sound physics to expect causation between energy consumption and wealth more specifically us mw and given over of energy comes from burning carbon including ancient oil coal gas old wood and recent biomass and the remaining of energy requires burning carbon for materials construction maintenance and energy distribution for example cement from natural gas steel from coal and diesel machines to mine and transport the concrete steel and uranium required to build and operate hydroelectric dams and nuclear plants and given wind and solar cant scale up to replace tw of burning carbon which for comparison is billion watt bulbs about per person because of low power density intermittency and high storage cost and because wind and solar requires burning carbon for materials construction maintenance and energy distribution for example concrete steel copper glass silicon and composites and diesel trucks to transport install and maintain the equipment and diesel machines to build and maintain the access roads and because wind and solar equipment wears out and must be replaced after years when there will be little remaining oil to do so and given that most do not understand the tight dependencies between burning carbon to create the wealth we enjoy and want more of nor burning carbon to make the nitrogen fertilizer our food requires nor burning carbon to pump the water we drink and irrigate crops with nor burning carbon for tractors and combines that permit us to specialize nor burning carbon to transport everything we depend on to survive nor burning carbon to make the concrete steel and glass we live in nor burning carbon for the vacations recreation and internet we enjoy nor burning carbon and population growth from to billion nor burning carbon and climate change that threatens our children nor burning carbon and sea level rise that threatens many cities nor burning carbon and aerosols that mask c additional warming nor burning carbon and ocean acidification that is killing coral reefs etc nor burning carbon and the sixth great extinction nor burning carbon and the collapse of fisheries nor burning carbon and rising ground level ozone that is killing trees and given that most are not aware of or preparing for the coming shitstorm caused by an energy price high enough to cover extraction costs that are rising per year due to depleting lowcost reserves is an energy price too high to permit economic growth and without growth debt defaults causing a depression so we conjure growth with new money created out of thin air by increasing debt which is a useful trick when real growth is possible but a deadly trick when there are limits to growth because it is equivalent to eating seed corn and this debt is exploding to unprecedented levels worldwide because it now takes more than of debt for of growth with total debt about us trillion triple that in forcing central banks to print money to keep interest rates low interest is not normal as all grownups know and this free money has created an illusion of oil abundance because fracking companies can operate despite losing money meaning much oil will disappear when interest rates rise and this free money has created bubbles of unprecedented size in stocks bonds real estate education healthcare etc that must eventually burst and revert through their mean hurting even the innocents who did not participate thus printing money will someday cause suffering and social unrest via a deflationary or hyperinflationary monetary collapse depending on how politicians respond from a much higher and harmful elevation than it needed to be because there is no such thing as a free lunch and we chose not to acknowledge limits and to live within our means despite being warned of the dangers since at least even though our means compared to most of history are excellent for example a poor canadian lives better than a pharaoh with our real wealth of net energy per person falling so falls our productivity because everything we do uses energy for example barrel of oil does years of manual labor so of oil replaces of minimum wages and we burn about billion barrels of oil per year meaning each of our billion is helped by energy slaves plus a similar number from coal gas hydro and nuclear and because weve already captured most efficiencies so falls our real incomes for all except the upper which profit from money printing and in addition to using debt the further masked declining real incomes by lowering the cost and price of manufactured items by consolidating shopping at walmart and amazon and by moving good paying manufacturing jobs to poorer countries which made us more vulnerable to supply chain disruptions because everything we need is now made elsewhere and because trucks trains and ships all burn diesel oil and cannot practically be made to run on anything else and this loss of good jobs further lowered incomes making citizens angry for example brexit and trump and if citizens continue to not understand the cause of decline nor the plentiful reasons to be thankful they may someday support a despot like hitler who was supported because of harm from weimar money printing and who blamed other tribes and promised war for gain but unlike past wars that rewarded victors with booty for example the us empire and its reserve currency the next war will return few rewards to the victor because weve already burned most of the good booty and well burn a lot more waging war and well risk annihilation with nuclear weapons that a desperate country without oil and hope may use so its therefore a really good idea for citizens to understand that geology biology and thermodynamics caused our predicament so citizens cant be persuaded to blame another person or tribe and so citizens see the blessing for their children of burning less carbon because a c rise caused the climate problems weve already experienced and another c rise is baked in no matter what we do because co passed ppm and is still rising meaning our great great great great grandchildren already have to contend with at least meters of sea level rise and were on a catastrophic path to another c rise or more meaning most humans in a few generations will not survive unless we soon mostly stop burning carbon which depletion will force anyway unfortunately too late and so citizens see the wisdom of using some remaining carbon wealth to build a softer landing zone in preparation for a world with local food and local economies and much less energy wealth complexity and population and given that our culture leaders and news focus almost exclusively on gdp growth which as weve seen is actually growth in burning carbon and given our need for constant reinforcement to fight our human tendency to deny unpleasant realities which blocks awareness discussion and action on every issue that matters for example climate change peak oil and overpopulation all symptoms of overshoot which the green party doesnt even mention we should seize a simple public education opportunity by renaming gdp gross domestic product to gdb gross domestic burn so every time we discuss the economy we worship we are reminded how fortunate we are to be alive on an extraordinarily rare and beautiful planet with extraordinarily rare and beautiful eukaryotic life with an extraordinarily rare and intelligent brain during the brief year period out of billion with abundant burning carbon and the many reasons for thankfulness and temperance",
