# Assuming 'a' is a previously defined variable. Let's assume a = 10 for these descriptions.

print("10 // 5 is", 10 // 5)
# This line performs integer division of 10 by 5. The result is the quotient without the remainder. The output will be 2.

print("a / 5 is", a / 5)
# This performs floating-point division of 'a' (which we assume is 10) by 5. The output will be 2.0.

print("a % 3 is", a % 3)
# This calculates the remainder when 'a' (10) is divided by 3. The output will be 1.

print("a ** 3 is", a ** 3)
# This calculates 'a' (10) raised to the power of 3. The output will be 1000.

print("a + 3 is", a + 3)
# This performs addition, adding 3 to 'a' (10). The output will be 13.

print("a - 3 is", a - 3)
# This performs subtraction, subtracting 3 from 'a' (10). The output will be 7.

print("a * 3 is", a * 3)
# This performs multiplication, multiplying 'a' (10) by 3. The output will be 30.

a += 3
print("After adding 3 to 'a', 'a' is", a)
# This is a shorthand for 'a = a + 3'. It adds 3 to the current value of 'a' and updates the variable. The new value of 'a' will be 13.
